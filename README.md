Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the discipline of designing,developing,testing and maintaining software applications and systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The software crisis.As software systems ecame larger and more complexin the 60'sit became clear thet ad-hoc programming methods were insyfficient for handling complex projects.
Structured programming. Structured programing emphasized on writingsoftware in a clear understandable and predictable manner. This included the use of control structures like loops and conditionals and the elimination of spaghetti code.
Object oriented programming. OOP focuses on the organization of software into objects that encapsulate data and behaviour. It promotes reusability,scalability and easier maintenance.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement gathering and analysis phase. In this phase, the goal is to understand the problem the software aims to solve, gather requirements from stakeholders and define what the software will do.
System design phase. This phase focuses on how the software will be structured an how all its components work together.
Implementation(coding) phase. The actual development of the software takes place by turning the design specifications into source code using appropriate programming languages.
Testing phase. This phase entails  veryfying the software works correctly and is free of bugs.
Deployment phase. This the phase where the software is installed and released to software users.
Maintenance phase. Regular updates,bug fixes and perfomance enhancements of the software takes place.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a traditional, linear approach to software development where each phase is completed before moving on to the next.Examples of a scenario where it is used is the construction of a simple, internal business with predefined requirements.
Agile methodology is an iterative, flexible approach to software development thet emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback and adapting to change throughout the development process. Example of a scenario in which it is used is the development of mobile apps where user feedback is important for improvements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product. Aside from that they are also responsible for sending updates to the project manager and the quality assurance rngineer.
A quality assurance engineer creates tests that identify issues with software vefore it is deployed.
A project manager helps the team design, execute, monitor and finish their work so that clients will receive high quality software products.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs help programmers develop sofware code efficiently by increasing developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, buildng, testing and packaging in an easy-to-use applications. Examples of IDEs are visual studio,eclipse and PyCharm.
VCS helps programmers keep track of changes made to code overtime. Examples of VCS include Git, Subversion and Perforce

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Complexity of software design. This challenge can be overcome by using modular design and regular code reviews to ensure that the design is sound and maintenable.
Bug fixing and debugging. To fix this challenge one could use automated testing by writing unit tests and end-ti-end tests to catch issues early in the development process.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing tests individual software components in isolation. Its importance is that it verifies that each component functions correctly.
Intergration testing combines software units into a group to test how they work together. It is used to fidn interface defects between modules.
System testing evaluates the software system as a whole to ensure it meets requirrements.
Acceptance testing ensures that the end user's needs are met.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the proces of refining generative AI  models and improving its responses. Its imprtanceis ensuring AI modelsmproduces accurate and relevant outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Generate a photo of a girl.
Improved prompt: Generate a photo of an african girl aged between nine and eleven years old adorned wiyth maasai ornaments.
The improved prompt is more effective since it gives a clearer description and will give a more accurate result of what the user wants.
